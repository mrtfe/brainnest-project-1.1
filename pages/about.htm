    CrossFit is a branded fitness regimen that involves constantly varied
    functional movements performed at high intensity. The method was developed
    by Greg Glassman, who founded CrossFit with Lauren Jenai in 2000, with
    CrossFit its registered trademark. The company forms what has been described
    as the biggest fitness chain in the world, with around 12,000 affiliated
    gyms in over 150 countries as of 2022, under half of which are located in
    the United States.

    CrossFit is promoted as both a physical exercise philosophy and a
    competitive fitness sport, incorporating elements from high-intensity
    interval training, Olympic weightlifting, plyometrics, powerlifting,
    gymnastics, kettlebell lifting, calisthenics, strongman, and other
    exercises.[11] It is practised by members in CrossFit-affiliated gyms, and
    by individuals who complete daily workouts (otherwise known as "WODs" or
    "Workouts of the Day").
    <br />
    CrossFit has been criticized for causing more injuries than other sporting
    activities such as traditional weightlifting; however, an article in the
    Journal of Sports Rehabilitation found that "the risk of injury from
    participation in CrossFit is comparable to or lower than some common forms
    of exercise or strength training". There are also concerns that its
    methodology may cause exertional rhabdomyolysis, a possible life-threatening
    breakdown of muscle from extreme exertion.
