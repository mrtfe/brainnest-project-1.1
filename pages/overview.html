  <p>
    CrossFit is a strength, conditioning, and overall fitness program consisting
    mainly of a mix of aerobic exercise, calisthenics (bodyweight exercises),
    and Olympic weightlifting. CrossFit, LLC describes its strength and
    conditioning program as "constantly varied functional movements executed at
    high intensity across broad time and modal domains." CrossFit aims to
    develop fitness in what the company deems to be the ten components of
    physical fitness: cardiovascular/respiratory endurance, stamina, strength,
    flexibility, power, speed, coordination, agility, balance, accuracy.
    Usually, the duration and content of each workout is not fixed.
    <br />
    Hour-long classes at affiliated gyms, or "boxes," typically include a
    warm-up, a skill development segment, the high-intensity "Workout of the
    Day" (or WOD), and a period of individual or group stretching. Some gyms
    also often have a strength-focused movement prior to the WOD, though
    CrossFit encourages most athletes to prioritize intensity over supplemental
    strength training or additional programming. Performance on each WOD is
    often scored and/or ranked to encourage competition and to track individual
    progress. Some affiliates offer additional classes, such as Olympic
    weightlifting, which are not centered on a WOD.
    <br />
    CrossFit gyms use equipment from multiple disciplines, including barbells,
    dumbbells, gymnastics rings, rope climbs, pull-up bars, jump ropes,
    kettlebells, medicine balls, plyo boxes, resistance bands, rowing machines,
    and various mats. CrossFit is focused on "constantly varied high-intensity
    functional movement," drawing on categories and exercises such as
    calisthenics, Olympic-style weightlifting, powerlifting, strongman-type
    events, plyometrics, bodyweight exercises, indoor rowing, aerobic exercise,
    running, and swimming.
    <br />
    CrossFit programming is decentralized, but its general methodology is used
    by thousands of private affiliated gyms, fire departments, law-enforcement
    agencies, and military organizations, including the Royal Danish Life
    Guards, as well as by some U.S. and Canadian high school physical education
    teachers, high school and college sports teams, and the Miami Marlins.
    <br />
    A 2014 statistical analysis showed that 50% of CrossFit participants were
    male and 50% were female. CrossFit's growing interest internationally has
    created a spike in Olympic weightlifting interest in the United States.
