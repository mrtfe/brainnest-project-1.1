  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>
    CrossFit, meaning cross-discipline fitness, was conceived as a company in
    1996 as Cross-Fit. Greg Glassman and Lauren Jenai incorporated CrossFit,
    Inc. in 2000. They opened a gym in Santa Cruz, California in 2001 and posted
    their workouts on the Internet for their clients, and these workouts were
    then quickly adopted by individuals in the police, military, firefighting
    services. The first affiliated gym (known as 'box') to form was CrossFit
    North in Seattle, Washington when Glassman's internet postings were used by
    those who wanted to officially incorporate his workouts into their training
    regimen in 2002.[19] Glassman then began to develop a curriculum to train
    and certify coaches and gym owners using his methodology. Coaches associated
    with CrossFit include Louie Simmons, John Welbourn, and Bob Harper.

    The number of CrossFit-affiliated gyms grew quickly: there were 13 gyms in
    2005, 8,000 in 2013, and more than 13,000 in 2016. By 2018, there were over
    15,000 CrossFit gyms in 162 countries. Its membership worldwide has been
    estimated to between two and five million. However, the COVID-19 pandemic
    forced the closure of around 20% of its gyms (around 25% in the US), and
    disaffiliations due to the Glassman controversy in 2020 further reduced the
    number of paid affiliations to 9,400 by early 2021. The number has since
    recovered to around 12,500 including non-paying affiliates (10,800 paying)
    by early 2022. Strong growth was observed in Europe, with France having the
    most CrossFit gyms outside of United States.

    Glassman obtained complete control over the company in 2012 after a divorce
    with Jenai, who tried to sell her share in the company to an outside party
    after the divorce settlement, but Glassman bought it with a $16 million loan
    from Summit Partners.

    On June 24, 2020, following the outcry after Glassman's comments regarding
    the murder of George Floyd it was announced that he was selling the company
    to Eric Roza, former CEO of Datalogix, in partnership with an investment
    firm Berkshire Partners. Roza assumed the role of CEO after the conclusion
    of the sale in July. In late November, CrossFit announced a building lease
    for its Boulder headquarters. At the end of 2020, CrossFit became an LLC.
